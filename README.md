# Temperatures in Victoria

A responsive line chart implemented with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [D3](https://d3js.org/) that shows
daily maximum temperatures in Victoria, BC in June 2021.

The number of axis ticks vary according to the chart size to avoid label overlapping on small-screen devices.

This project was bootstrapped with the [Svelte app template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).
